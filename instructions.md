**Project Name:** Game AI Training Based on Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Project Goal:** 

The first mini-project is a simple AI maze game. Using the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning, train the AI to find a path through the maze with high probability and generally move along this path. The second mini-project is based on the Atari game Pong provided by the Gym library. Using the Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm from deep reinforcement learning, train the AI to play a game of Pong against the computer.
